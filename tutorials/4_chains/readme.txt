 In this tutorial, we construct chains with Cr atoms on top of the NbSe2 substrate. First we start with 2 Cr atoms, then 3 Cr atoms and finally 4, which in this supercell simulates an infinite chain,
 given the periodic boundary conditions.

 Wannier funcions included:

 2Cr:

 10 d orbitals of Cr
 80 d orbitals of Nb
 96 p orbitals of Se

 3Cr:

 15 d orbitals of Cr
 80 d orbitals of Nb
 96 p orbitals of Se
