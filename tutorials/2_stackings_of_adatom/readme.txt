 In this tutorial, we analyze the effect of a Cr adatom on top of NbSe2. In particular we analyze the effect of the stacking in different postions of the substrate (being the groundstate the situation where the adatom lies in the Centre of NbSe2 empy spaces)
 Wannier funcions included:
  5 d orbitals of Cr
 80 d orbitals of Nb
 92 p orbitals of Se
