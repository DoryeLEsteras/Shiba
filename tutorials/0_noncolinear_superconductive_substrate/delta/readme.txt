 In this tutorial, we simulate the NbSe2 substrate in absence of any magnetic atom.
 In particular, we illustrate how the program works when noncolinear calculations provide a unique Hamiltonian file, with both spin components included.

 Wannier functions included:
 160 d orbitals of Nb
 192 p orbitals of Se
