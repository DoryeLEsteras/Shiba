Tutorial 4: building magnetic chains
====================================
The objective of this tutorial is to start building chains on top of the SC. We ilustrated this in three steps:

First, a second adatom is deposited in the NbSe2 surface, thus we have a chain formed by two adatoms. The next step includes a third Cr atom, given rise to a three adatom chain.
Finally we finish this tutorial adding a forth adatom, which completes the crystal cell used. This means according to the boundary conditions of DFT we have an infinite chain,
where both extremes see each other. This tutorial could be extended increasing the dimensions of the NbSe2 supercell and adding more adatoms.

WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS CHAINS? ARE THERE MORE PEAKS? THE INFINITE CHAIN LOOKS REALLY LIKE AN INFINITY CHAIN USING JUST 4 ATOMS?
