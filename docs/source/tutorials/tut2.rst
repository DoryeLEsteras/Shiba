Tutorial 2: Different stackings of magnetic adatoms
===================================================
Similarly to the previous tutorial (indeed stm and sub files are going to be the same) we study the effect of a magnetic atom, this time a Cr adatom on top of the NbSe2 surface.
In partcular we provide as an example, three different stackings, in the first one, the Cr atom lies in the central space between the Se atoms (this is the ground state). Moreover,
two alternative non-ground-state situations are provided, when Cr is stacked on top of Nb atoms and on top of Se.
In all these scenarios, the 10 d orbitals of Cr (5 up and 5 down) are directly connected to the stm tip given they are on top of the surface and the stm tip can be connected to them.
With this setup, Shiba states appear inside of the SC gap.

CONNECTING SE TO THE TIP REMOVES THE SHIBA??
IS POSSIBLE TO MEASURE DIFFERENT INTENSITIES DEPENDING ON THE STACKING??
