Tutorial 3: Displacing magnetic adatoms from the surface
========================================================
Now we comeback to the ground state stacking of the previous tutorial (centre). We want to study how the peak spectrum is altered when you displace the Cr atom far away from the surface,
The connections of the setup are the same than in the previous tutorial, but in each of the DFT simulations, the Cr atom has been displaced from the surface.

DO WE OBSERVE THE SHIBA STARTS DISAPEARING??
