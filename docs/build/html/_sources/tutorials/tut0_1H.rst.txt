Tutorial 0: SC substrate with spinors
=====================================
In this first tutorial, we will study the most simple case we can consider, a 2D superconductor in absence of magnetic species.
DFT + Wannier calculations were performed in a monolayer of NbSe2 thus, the Wannier Hamiltonian contains all the data we require.
(in this particular case we used a supercell to be consistent with the rest of the tutorials, where magnetic species are included
around this structure, however, a unit cell of NbSe2 can be considered for this tutorial)

First, this tutorial contains two different simulations. The first one includes spin-orbit coupling, thus there is one unique Hamiltonian 
based in the spinor description. The second contains two different Hamiltonians, corresponding to the spin up and spin down Wannierizations.
Depending on the colinear or noncolinear nature of simulations, you will need to specify the names of your files using 'up_h' and 'down_h' 
options, or just using 'comb_h', you should not worry about anything else!

Together with the Wannier Hamiltonian, three inputs should be constructed, the main input of the simulations, and two lists of orbitals, 
the one containing the orbitals connected to the STM tip and the ones contected to the other electrode. In this particular case, we have
176 Wannier functions, the first 80 correspond to the d orbitals of the Nb atoms that are in the middle of the material. The next 96 Wannier functions
correspond to the p orbitals of Se atoms, which belong to two groups (the two borders surfaces of the material). Herein, we construct the stm.in file 
with the Se atoms in the top surface of NbSe2 and the sub.in file that contains the bottom surface orbitals. (is also possible to connect the stm tip to
just one small group of p orbitals, something that in this particular case will not affect the results, but will slightly reduce the current and thus, the intensity
of the peaks)

Finally, the file input can be constracted using the tool create_shiba_template.py and choosing carefully the contents of the file (see How to use section to understand the different parameters).
In this set of examples we highlight the value of delta extracted for NbSe2 superconductor (0.00135 meV), the parameters nc=2 was enough to converged the differential conductivity and that the value of voltage range
(vran) provides a window containing the states close to the Fermi, where the SC gap will be opened.

Observe how the value of Delta opens a SC gap in the spectrum, however there are no peaks inside of this gap given the absence of magnetic species around.
