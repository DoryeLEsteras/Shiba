Tutorial 1: SC substrate with substitutional defect
===================================================
In this tutorial we study the particular case of a substitutional magnetic impurity (Cr atom) occupyng the place of a Nb in the same NbSe2 monolayer of the previous tutorial.
You can see the stm tip is still connected to the external Se p orbitals of the top surface of NbSe2, and the bottom Se p orbitals are connected to the other electrode.
The d orbitals of Cr are not connected, given they are inside in the sample. Adjusting correctly the voltage range (vran)
We can see the states in the borders of the Fermi level, adding the Delta parameter of NbSe2 already introduced in the previous tutorial, a gap is opened between this levels, and given the
presence of the magnetic impurity, Shiba peaks start to appear inside of the SC gap.
ALPHA IS NECESSARY FOR SHIBA??
